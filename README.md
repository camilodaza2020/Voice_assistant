
#Important

-Remember to install an environment in order to avoid problems between installations of the libraries.

-Create the MVP file where once you run it, it should generate an interface or link, enter and test the model.

-This model has not yet concexion to the openai api, but it has good performance for testing

-Also the transcript file should generate another interface where you can upload your mp3 file and take the transcript.

I will try still modifing and improving the model !
